NEW FEATURES IN DETAIL:

- Start positions

  Start positions are now assigned based on battleroom teams/alliances.
  With fixed positions, host and their team are assigned the odd positions in the order that they joined the lobby.
  With random positions, host and their team are randomly assigned the even or odd positions, and they are assigned in random order.

  The Teams icons now function correctly, so they can be used to arrange teams in the battleroom if desired.
  This is optional, it is perfectly fine to arrange teams by creating alliances too.

- Autoteam

  In the battleroom, host can type "+autoteam" to have teams assigned automatically.
  These teams will then determine the start positions as described above.

  If launched from TAF, the battleroom +autoteam will assign autobalanced teams based on the player rating.
  Otherwise teams are assigned randomly.

  Alternatively, if host types "+autoteam" in-game, alliances are created based on actual start positions.
  
  For more than 2 teams, host can type eg "+autoteam 3" to create the desired number of teams.

- MexSnap and WreckSnap

  This patch includes ability to snap mexes and geos to the nearest metal or geo patch (MexSnap),
  and to snap reclaim commands to the nearest reclaim (WreckSnap).

  While holding down shift, press q and e alternately to switch between building mexes and reclaiming features.

  If Mex/WreckSnap is temporarily interfering with your wishes,
  you can hold down alt to override it.
  The override key can be configured in the ctrl-f2 options menu.

  The Mex/WreckSnap radii can also be configured independently via the ctrl-f2 options menu.
  Press ctrl-f2, click on the "MexSnap" or "WreckSnap" field and press a number 0 to 9.
  0 disables the Mex/WreckSnap and a larger radius results in snapping to features further away.

  Note that the maximum Mex/WreckSnap radius is capped at 0 by default, effectively disabling the Mex/WreckSnap.
  It needs to be enabled by the mod maintainer.
  If your Mex/WreckSnap radius won't increase above 0 in the ctrl-f2 menu,
  it is likely that Mex/WreckSnap hasn't been enabled by your mod maintainer.

- Move Queued Orders

  After queueing a build order or a move order,
  you can later move them around by selecting the unit
  and left mouse dragging the order to a new position.

- Construction Units Patrol Behaviour

  Patrol behaviour of contructions units is modified depending on their movement orders:

    Hold Position: your construction units will only look for reclaim
    Maneuvre/roam: your construction units will both look for reclaim and for units that need repair or assist

  Mash the 'v' key to get the desired movement order and then set a patrol route.
