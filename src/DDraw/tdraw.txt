Drop tdraw.dll into your TA directory.
Ensure the following files are also present in your TA directory:
- ddraw.dll (available from https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw)
- totala.ini

You might need to rename totala.ini to whatever .ini file name your mod is using.
e.g. ProTA4.5 is using ta.ini and ESC is using TAESC.ini

Same applies for tdraw.dll, you may need to rename it for some mods.
